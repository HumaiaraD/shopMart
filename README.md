A fun interactive game about shopping experince.

Game Description:
Welcome to "Life in the Town Square", an interactive text-based adventure where you navigate through daily life, make purchases, and interact with various characters. Your goal is to manage your resources wisely, explore different locations, and avoid running out of money or causing conflicts that could end your game.

In this game, you start with a modest amount of money ($100) and a basic inventory containing just a bottle of water. As you explore the town, you can visit places like the Grocery Store, Restaurant, and Town Square. Each location offers different opportunities to earn or spend money, and your interactions with friends and businesses will influence your experience. After spending enough money shopping, you get a restart buttons to restart or ask for loan from a friend. 

Coding:
I used simple Javascript, CSS, HTML coding for this game. 
I was inspired from a project i did in freeCodeCamp certification. The project was to make a dragon slaying game and I was inspired to do something similar to it.
